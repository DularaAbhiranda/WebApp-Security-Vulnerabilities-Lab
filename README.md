# üîê WebApp-Security-Vulnerabilities-Lab

This repository demonstrates **five critical web application security vulnerabilities** with both vulnerable and secure implementations. Each example is designed to provide hands-on experience in understanding, exploiting, and mitigating real-world security flaws across multiple technologies.

## üìö Project Overview

This project includes the following vulnerabilities:

| #  | Vulnerability                | Language/Tech Stack | Exploitation Method                 | Secure Fix Included |
|----|------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1  | SQL Injection (SQLi)         | PHP + MySQL         | Injection via login forms           | ‚úÖ Prepared Statements |
| 2  | Buffer Overflow              | C (CLI app)         | Stack overflow with unchecked input | ‚úÖ Safe input handling |
| 3  | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)   | PHP + HTML          | JavaScript injection in comments    | ‚úÖ Output encoding + CSP |
| 4  | Java Deserialization         | Java + Tomcat       | Remote code execution via payload   | ‚úÖ Class whitelisting + JSON |
| 5  | Broken Authentication (OAuth2 misuse) | PHP OAuth Client | Session fixation, CSRF             | ‚úÖ State + PKCE + validation |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DularaAbhiranda/WebApp-Security-Vulnerabilities-Lab.git
cd WebApp-Security-Vulnerabilities-Lab
````


2. Explore Vulnerabilities
Each folder contains:

vulnerable/ ‚Äì Insecure version

secure/ ‚Äì Fixed secure version

README.md ‚Äì Instructions and test cases

Example:

```
cd sql-injection/vulnerable
3. Run the Code
Use XAMPP or LAMP for PHP-based systems
```

Compile C code with:
```
gcc -o demo buffer_overflow.c
./demo
```

Deploy Java projects using Apache Tomcat

Test XSS and OAuth flows using modern browsers or Burp Suite

üß† What You'll Learn
How security flaws are introduced in code

How to simulate exploitation techniques

How to fix vulnerabilities using secure coding

The importance of validation, encoding, and safe design

Defense-in-depth and SDL-based thinking
